# TrackingRecords
Given, a table of transaction records with a starting tracking number, ending tracking number, status code and transfer code, 
the table must always accurately represent the most recent data (status code and transfer code) for that tracking number. 

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>Each input case begins with a single line that is a character string naming the test case. This string contains at most 80 
characters. The name "END" marks the end of the input. Following this will be 1 to 100 lines of the form "A B S T", where A, B,
and T are integers in the range 1 to 231-1, S is an uppercase letter, and A<=B. These lines are, in the order they are to be 
applied, the tracking number transactions to be recorded, where A is the start of the tracking number range, B is the end of
the tracking number range, S is the status code, and T is the transfer code. The list of tracking number transactions is 
terminated by a line containing only a 0 (zero) character.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each input case, echo the test case name to the output on a line by itself, followed by the resulting minimal-rows 
tracking number table that results after all tracking number transactions have been applied.</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The tracking numbers a re fed into a linked list and arranged in an ascending order. An associated hash map holds the status 
code and transfer code for that transaction number. As one parses through the records, the values of status code and transfer code are 
overwritten. At last, go through the list and output the processed transaction records.</p>
